<p>The guiding principle of my research is using all possible sources of information to address challenging ecological questions, especially in the ocean where data are limited and expensive. This often entails data mining and archival digging, historical investigations, and the analysis of unconventional data. I exploit meta-analysis, Bayesian methods, and hierarchical modeling for integrating numerous and heterogeneous data sources; and use tools in computer and data science to acquire, manage and process this information.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://baseline.stanford.edu">Shark Baselines Project</a> aims to investigate the structure and population abundance of large sharks in natural ecosystems and to infer global change in their abundance as an effect of human perturbation.</p>

  <summary>Characterize the identity and structure of extinct Mediterranean sawfish and neighboring Atlantic populations. (Click to expand)</summary>
Through archival digging, literature analyses, and extinction models, we provided evidence for the historical occurrence and subsequent extinction of two sawfish species in the Mediterranean Sea (Pristis pristis and Pristis pectinata) (Ferretti et al. 2016). This research challenged established tenets on sawfish ecology and biogeography, and led to a larger collaborative initiative for investigating on the structure, distribution, phylogeny, and biogeography of recently extinct sawfish populations. Within this project, we are conducting morphometric, genetic and isotopic analyses of sawfish materials from Mediterranean, European and Western African museums, to characterize the identity and structure of extinct Mediterranean sawfish and neighboring Atlantic populations.

<p><img src="assets/bottom_trawlingNarrow.png" alt="AMER" width="700" align="center" /></p>

<p>Very large marine protected areas (LMPA &gt; 75,000 km2) are increasingly popular to protect the last strongholds of biodiversity in the ocean and promote recovery of heavily exploited regions. Yet not all agree on their value for management and conservation. Challenges are demonstrating that positive outcomes observed in smaller coastal MPAs also occur at such large scales and that monitoring and enforcement over vast and remote oceanic regions are possible. Through the <strong>Bertarelli Programme in Marine Science</strong>, an international collaborative initiative focused on the Chagos Archipelago in the British Indian Ocean Territory, I am investigating on the structure and function of pristine coral reef ecosystems, the impact of large marine protected areas on the management and conservation of sharks and other broad-ranging marine megafauna, the fundamental spatial ecology of these animals, and the effectiveness of mega-reserves in remote oceanic regions.</p>

<p>As a research partner of the <a href="http://globalfishingwatch.org/">Global Fishing Watch</a> I am working on understanding patterns of high-seas fishing effort across the globe and how global fishing fleets interact with large pelagic fish and sharks. This work will be applied to inform marine spatial planning and fisheries management for areas outside national jurisdictions.</p>
