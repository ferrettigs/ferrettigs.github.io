<p>The <a href="http://baseline.stanford.edu">Shark Baselines Project</a> aims to investigate the structure and population abundance of large sharks in natural ecosystems and to infer global change in their abundance as an effect of human perturbation.</p>

<p>As a research partner of the <a href="http://globalfishingwatch.org/">Global Fishing Watch</a> I am working on understanding patterns of high-seas fishing effort across the globe and how global fishing fleets interact with large pelagic fish and sharks. This work will be applied to inform marine spatial planning and fisheries management for areas outside national jurisdictions.</p>

<h2 id="reconstructing-the-history-of-mediterranean-sawfish-populations">Reconstructing the History of Mediterranean Sawfish Populations</h2>

<p>Through archival digging, literature analyses, and extinction models, we provided evidence for the historical occurrence and subsequent extinction of two sawfish species in the Mediterranean Sea (Pristis pristis and Pristis pectinata) (Ferretti et al. 2016). This research challenged established tenets on sawfish ecology and biogeography, and led to a larger collaborative initiative for investigating on the structure, distribution, phylogeny, and biogeography of recently extinct sawfish populations. Within this project, we are conducting morphometric, genetic and isotopic analyses of sawfish materials from Mediterranean, European and Western African museums, to characterize the identity and structure of extinct Mediterranean sawfish and neighboring Atlantic populations.</p>
