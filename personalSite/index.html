I am a quantitative and computational marine ecologist specialized in research synthesis. My scientific work is on marine conservation, fishery sciences, population dynamics, and quantitative ecology with a special interest in cartilaginous fish. I combine quantitative ecology, statistical modeling, and computer science to compiling, integrating and analyzing large datasets, and developing analytical approaches for estimating abundance and distribution of animal populations from multiple sources of data and approach ecological questions on animal abundance and distribution, species interactions, large marine predators, top-down control, structure and functioning of large marine ecosystems.

I am postdoctoral fellow at Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University working on a global project on baselines of abundance and distribution of sharks <a href="http://baseline.stanford.edu"> www.sharkbaselines.org </a> in the lab of Fiorenza Micheli. I have obtained my PhD in marine ecology at Dalhousie University working with Ransom Myers, Heike Lotze, and Andrew Rosenberg.
